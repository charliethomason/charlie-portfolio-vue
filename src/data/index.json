  "bio": "My name is Charlie, and I live at the intersection of creativity and engineering. By day, I am a Senior UI Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.centro.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Centro</a>, and have been writing code full-time for over 8 years. By night, I am an artist who loves working with ink, watercolor, and oil. In 2016, I self-published a book of my paintings titled, <a href=\"https://www.blurb.com/b/7500748-birds-of-chicagoland\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Birds of Chicagoland</em></a>. In addition to being an engineer and artist, I am also a musician and guitarist for the Louisville, KY band <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/echosaim\" target=\"_blank\">Echo's Aim</a>. I currently live in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago with my wife, Amanda, and cat, Baxter. This website is a portfolio of some of my best art and coding work.",
